## 📢 Week 5 Focus: Data Analysis Using SQL 🎯  

After conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Excel Pivot Tables** in Week 4, this week’s focus was on performing **structured and optimized data analysis using SQL**.  

📌 **Why SQL for Data Analysis?**  
SQL is an essential tool for querying, filtering, and analyzing large datasets efficiently. By leveraging SQL, we can extract **valuable insights** and perform **aggregations, joins, and trend analysis** in an optimized way.

## 🔥 Week 5 Progress 🚀  

### ✅ **1. Setting Up the SQL Environment** 🛠️  
🔹 **Loaded the cleaned dataset into SQL Database** (MySQL/PostgreSQL) 🗄️  
🔹 **Created tables & defined schema** (data types, constraints) 📋  
🔹 **Checked for data integrity and consistency** 🔎   


### ✅ **2. Writing SQL Queries for Analysis** 🏗️  
🔸 Performed **data filtering & selection** using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY` 📊  
🔸 Used **aggregations (`COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `GROUP BY`)** to analyze trends 📈  
🔸 Applied **joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)** to combine multiple tables 🔗  
🔸 Used **window functions (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`)** for advanced analytics 🏆  


### ✅ **3. Key SQL Queries & Findings** 🔍  
#### 🔹 **1️⃣ Most Preferred Career Paths Among Gen Z:**  
```sql
SELECT career_path, COUNT(*) AS total_responses
FROM survey_data
GROUP BY career_path
ORDER BY total_responses DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
🔹 **Insight:** The top 3 career paths chosen by Gen Z are **[Career 1], [Career 2], [Career 3]** 🚀  


#### 🔹 **2️⃣ Salary Expectations by Industry:**  
```sql
SELECT industry, AVG(expected_salary) AS avg_salary
FROM survey_data
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```
🔹 **Insight:** **[Industry X]** offers the highest expected salaries 💰  


#### 🔹 **3️⃣ Work-Life Balance Preferences:**  
```sql
SELECT work_life_balance, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM survey_data
GROUP BY work_life_balance
ORDER BY count DESC;
```
🔹 **Insight:** **X%** of respondents prefer jobs with strong work-life balance ⚖️  


### ✅ **4. Documentation & Submission** 📑  
🔸 Compiled **SQL query outputs & insights** into a summary report 📝  
🔸 Exported the final results as a **CSV file** 📂  
🔸 Shared findings with my mentor for feedback ✅

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions 💡  

⚠️ **Challenge:** Large dataset slowed down SQL queries.  
✔️ **Solution:** Optimized queries using **indexes & efficient filtering**.  

⚠️ **Challenge:** Missing or NULL values in key fields.  
✔️ **Solution:** Used **`COALESCE()` function** to handle missing values.  

⚠️ **Challenge:** Understanding complex data relationships.  
✔️ **Solution:** Used **JOINs & subqueries** for better insights.
