## 📢 Week 4 Focus: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🎯  

After successfully **cleaning and standardizing** the dataset in Week 3, this week’s focus was on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Excel Pivot Tables**.  

📌 **Why is EDA Important?**  
EDA helps us **understand patterns, trends, and relationships** within the dataset before moving to deeper analysis. Using **Pivot Tables**, we can efficiently summarize and visualize key insights! 📊

🔹 **Identified relationships** between variables to explore further 📈  

### ✅ **2. Pivot Table Implementation in Excel** 🏗️  
🔸 Created **Pivot Tables** to analyze:  
   - **Career Preferences by Age Group** 🎓  
   - **Preferred Work Locations (Remote vs. On-Site)** 🏡🏢  
   - **Salary Expectations by Industry** 💰  
   - **Work-Life Balance Ratings by Job Type** ⚖️  
   - **Most Popular Career Paths among Gen Z** 🚀  
🔸 Used **filters, slicers, and grouping features** for deeper insights 🎯  

### ✅ **3. Data Visualization & Charts** 📊  
🔹 Created **Pivot Charts** to visually represent findings 📈  
🔹 Used **bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs** for trend analysis 🔍  
🔹 Enhanced readability with **conditional formatting** 🎨  

### ✅ **4. Documentation & Submission** 📑  
🔸 Compiled key insights in an **EDA Summary Report** 📝  
🔸 Exported Pivot Tables & Charts as an **Excel file (.xlsx)** 📂  
🔸 Shared findings with my mentor for review ✅
