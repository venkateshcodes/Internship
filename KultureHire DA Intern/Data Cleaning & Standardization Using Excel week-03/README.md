## 📢 Week 3 Focus: Data Cleaning & Standardization 🎯  

In this phase of the project **"Understanding the Career Aspirations of Generation Z"**, I worked on **cleaning and standardizing** the raw dataset provided by my mentor.  

💡 **Why is data cleaning important?**  
Unstructured or messy data can lead to incorrect analysis and insights. Through **Excel-based** cleaning and preprocessing, I transformed raw, unstructured data into a **clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset**.

## 🔥 Week 3 Progress 🚀  

### ✅ **1. Understanding the Raw Dataset** 📂  
🔹 **Received raw data from the mentor** – unstructured & inconsistent 📊  
🔹 **Analyzed the dataset** to identify missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues 🔎  
🔹 **Defined data cleaning steps** to ensure high-quality analysis 🎯  

### ✅ **2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing in Excel** 🧹  
🔸 **Removed duplicates** to avoid redundancy 🚫  
🔸 **Handled missing values** using appropriate strategies ❌  
🔸 **Corrected formatting issues** (dates, text case standardization) 📆🔠  
🔸 **Filtered out irrelevant data** to improve dataset relevance 🔍  

### ✅ **3. Data Standardization & Formatting** 🏗️  
🔹 **Converted categorical values** into a consistent format 🔤  
🔹 **Standardized numeric values** (salary expectations, work hours, etc.) 💰  
🔹 **Applied proper column naming conventions** for clarity 📛  
🔹 **Formatted the dataset for easy readability** 📑  

### ✅ **4. Documentation & Submission** 📑  
🔸 **Prepared a report on the cleaning process** 📝  
🔸 **Uploaded the cleaned dataset for mentor review** ✅  
🔸 **Exported & shared as an Excel file (.xlsx)** 📂

## 📊 Key Fixes & Improvements  

🔹 ✅ **Before:** Inconsistent date formats → **After:** Standardized YYYY-MM-DD 📆  
🔹 ✅ **Before:** Missing values in salary expectations → **After:** Imputed with median values 💰  
🔹 ✅ **Before:** Duplicated survey responses → **After:** Removed duplicates 📋  
🔹 ✅ **Before:** Job titles in different cases (ex: "Data Analyst", "data analyst") → **After:** Standardized text formatting 🔤

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions 💡  

⚠️ **Challenge:** Large dataset with missing values ❌  
✔️ **Solution:** Used **Excel formulas & conditional formatting** to highlight and impute missing values 📊  

⚠️ **Challenge:** Different date formats across responses 📆  
✔️ **Solution:** Used **TEXT & DATEVALUE functions** to standardize format 🔄  

⚠️ **Challenge:** Inconsistent job titles & industry names 🔠  
✔️ **Solution:** Applied **Find & Replace, Power Query, and data validation** for consistency ✅

## ⏭️ Next Steps for Week 4  

🚀 **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python** 🐍  
🚀 **Generate visual insights from the cleaned dataset** 📈  
🚀 **Identify patterns and trends in Gen Z career choices** 🔍  
🚀 **Prepare insights report for mentor review** 📝
